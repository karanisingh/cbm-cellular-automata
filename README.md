# cbm-cellular-automata

run 'python run.py --help' in command line


This repo is organized more like a library as opposed to one dedicated just to create our final model.


## Models
- BasicCellularAutomata
- BasicProbabilisticCellularAutomata


## CURRENT BUGS / TODOS
- Last frame of 2 state automates show all susceptible (instead of all infected)
    - don't know how to fix, tried for many hours
    - issue has to deal with the way it is being visualized: NOT from the cellular automata itself.
